## Deployment

To deploy this project : 
- Download the code into a folder 'food_delivery_app' and extract the files there. 
- Open the folder in VSCode, and in terminal run 'flutter pub get' command to install the dependencies.
- Have an android emulator device set up on your system to build and run the app from 'main.dart' file.


## Features

- The implemented solution is heavily based on the design reference provided in https://dribbble.com/shots/15082658-Food-Delivery-App.

- The following logical and structural behaviours have been implemented :
    1. Home screen : 
        - Horizontal list of food items.
        - List of food items.
    2. Food item details bottom sheet
    3. Cart screen
    4. States are created locally : (Cart Logic Implementation)
        - List of food items
        - Add food items to Cart
        - Remove food items from Cart
    5. Images and Icon assets used are from : https://www.graphicsfuel.com/30-isolated-food-images/
    6. Carousel has been implemented for Popular food card tile

- You may notice that the fonts used in the main application are not exactly same to the design inspo as the exact font is not available on Windows/Andorid/Googlefonts library. The font used in the project implementation is roboto family, since i found it to be the closest resemblence.

- Images assets used in the project app are for representation purpose only, based on available free library of assets. 

- Icons assets used in project app are for representation purpose only, based on available free library of assets. 

- Journey is implemented based on design inspo and list of tasks to be accomplished mentioned above.


## Optimizations

The code redundancy is close to negligible and clean code concepts have been used to optimize the execution of code. 

'const' keyword used everywhere required.

Functional elements based on the scope of this project are dynamically generated and not static or hard coded. 


## Roadmap for future scope depending upon journey details

- Side Menu Bar

- App Bar : Top live location tracking feature with estimated minutes 

- Search functionality in list of food items 

- Payments gateway integration

- Customer care support 

- Order confirmation and cancellation screens.
